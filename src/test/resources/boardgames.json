You'll need to coordinate with your teammates and use every available resource if you hope to survive the scorching heat and relentless sandstorm. Find the flying machine and escape before you all become permanent artifacts of the Forbidden Desert! When we launched Forbidden Island in 2010, we had an inkling that we had created a hit game but never to the point that we'd be prompted to make a sequel. Well, here we are a few years later with just that in hand. Our challenge to designer Matt Leacock was to create a game that would contain familiar elements (cooperative play, modular board), while offering up a completely different in-game experience. In addition, we wanted it to be simultaneously approachable to new players while upping the ante for those who felt they had mastered Forbidden Island. All this resulted in a fresh new game with an innovative set of mechanics, such as an ever-shifting board, individual resource management, and unique method for locating the flying machine parts. Hopefully we've achieved our goals and quenched your thirst for adventure!</p>",

  "description": "<p>The War of the Ring has begun!<br />The War of the Ring is a grand strategy board game that allows its players to immerse themselves in the world of J.R.R Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings and experience its epic action, dramatic conflict, and memorable characters.<br /><br />As the Free Peoples player you command the proud hosts of the most important kingdoms of the Third Age. From the horse-lords of Rohan to the soldiers of Gondor and the Elven lords of Rivendell, you lead the defense of the last free realms of Middle-earth.<br /><br />Face the evil minions of Sauron on the field of battle in a desperate attempt to delay their onslaught, while you lead the Fellowship of the Ring in the Quest for Mount Doom.<br /><br />As the Shadow player you lead the hordes of the Dark Lord and his most powerful minions as they try to bring darkness to Middle-earth. Legions of Orcs, Trolls, Wolfriders, and the dreadful Ringwraiths await your command. Hunt the Ring-bearer and bring the precious Ring to his Master, or crush your enemies with your unstoppable armies.<br /><br />This is your chance to forge the destiny of an age!</p>\r\n<div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p>In <em><strong>War of the Ring</strong></em>, one player takes control of the Free Peoples (FP), the other player controls Shadow Armies (SA). Initially, the Free People Nations are reluctant to take arms against Sauron, so they must be attacked by Sauron or persuaded by Gandalf or other Companions, before they start to fight properly: this is represented by the Political Track, which shows if a Nation is ready to fight in the War of the Ring or not.</p>\r\n<p>The game can be won by a military victory, if Sauron conquers a certain number of Free People cities and strongholds or vice versa. But the true hope of the Free Peoples lies with the quest of the Ringbearer: while the armies clash across Middle Earth, the Fellowship of the Ring is trying to get secretly to Mount Doom to destroy the One Ring. Sauron is not aware of the real intention of his enemies but is looking across Middle Earth for the precious Ring, so that the Fellowship is going to face numerous dangers, represented by the rules of The Hunt for the Ring. But the Companions can spur the Free Peoples to the fight against Sauron, so the Free People player must balance the need to protect the Ringbearer from harm, against the attempt to raise a proper defense against the armies of the Shadow, so that they do not overrun Middle Earth before the Ringbearer completes his quest.</p>\r\n<p>Each game turn revolves around the roll of Action Dice: each die corresponds to an action that a player can do during a turn. Depending on the face rolled on each die, different actions are possible (moving armies, characters, recruiting troops, advancing a Political Track).</p>\r\n<p>Action Dice can also be used to draw or play Event Cards. Event Cards are played to represent specific events from the story (or events that could possibly have happened) that cannot be portrayed through normal game-play.

The War of the Ring is a grand strategy board game that allows its players to immerse themselves in the world of J.R.R Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings and experience its epic action, dramatic conflict, and memorable characters.  As the Free Peoples player you command the proud hosts of the most important kingdoms of the Third Age. From the horse-lords of Rohan to the soldiers of Gondor and the Elven lords of Rivendell, you lead the defense of the last free realms of Middle-earth.  Face the evil minions of Sauron on the field of battle in a desperate attempt to delay their onslaught, while you lead the Fellowship of the Ring in the Quest for Mount Doom.  As the Shadow player you lead the hordes of the Dark Lord and his most powerful minions as they try to bring darkness to Middle-earth. Legions of Orcs, Trolls, Wolfriders, and the dreadful Ringwraiths await your command. Hunt the Ring-bearer and bring the precious Ring to his Master, or crush your enemies with your unstoppable armies.  This is your chance to forge the destiny of an age! \r\n \r\n \r\n In   War of the Ring  , one player takes control of the Free Peoples (FP), the other player controls Shadow Armies (SA). Initially, the Free People Nations are reluctant to take arms against Sauron, so they must be attacked by Sauron or persuaded by Gandalf or other Companions, before they start to fight properly: this is represented by the Political Track, which shows if a Nation is ready to fight in the War of the Ring or not. \r\n The game can be won by a military victory, if Sauron conquers a certain number of Free People cities and strongholds or vice versa. But the true hope of the Free Peoples lies with the quest of the Ringbearer: while the armies clash across Middle Earth, the Fellowship of the Ring is trying to get secretly to Mount Doom to destroy the One Ring. Sauron is not aware of the real intention of his enemies but is looking across Middle Earth for the precious Ring, so that the Fellowship is going to face numerous dangers, represented by the rules of The Hunt for the Ring. But the Companions can spur the Free Peoples to the fight against Sauron, so the Free People player must balance the need to protect the Ringbearer from harm, against the attempt to raise a proper defense against the armies of the Shadow, so that they do not overrun Middle Earth before the Ringbearer completes his quest. \r\n Each game turn revolves around the roll of Action Dice: each die corresponds to an action that a player can do during a turn. Depending on the face rolled on each die, different actions are possible (moving armies, characters, recruiting troops, advancing a Political Track). \r\n Action Dice can also be used to draw or play Event Cards. Event Cards are played to represent specific events from the story (or events that could possibly have happened) that cannot be portrayed through normal game-play. Each Event Card can also create an unexpected turn in the game, allowing special actions or altering the course of a battle. \r\n \r\n ",

  "description": "<p>Explore a massive cavern and build your new village above and below ground in this storytelling/town-building mashup board game.<br /><br />Your last village was ransacked by barbarians. You barely had time to pick up the baby and your favorite fishing pole before they started the burning and pillaging. You wandered over a cruel desert, braved frozen peaks, and even paddled a log across a rough sea, kicking at the sharks whenever they got too close, the baby strapped tightly to your back.<br /><br />Then you found it! The perfect place to make your new home.

During the day, players travel far and wide, visiting villages to acquire quests, monuments to learn powerful spells, mushroom groves to seek guidance, and treacherous locations in search of artifacts! Acquiring artifacts empower the heroes with unique abilities; this may improve a heroes' movement or combat, or their ability to learn spells or mitigate harmful dice rolls.<br /><br />Heroes must travel by foot, by horse, by raft, by boat, and by gryphon to get to all the places they need to go to satisfy their quests - or to position themselves for what night brings.

  "description": "<div><strong>Kingdom Death: Monster</strong> is a fully cooperative, tabletop, hobby game experience. Unite to survive by hunting monsters and collectively guiding the development of your settlement through a 30 year, self-running campaign.</div>\r\n<div> </div>\r\n<div>Every decision matters. A space moved during the showdown, every resource spent to craft a piece of gear, what principles your settlement upholds - all can have lasting impact on this highly replayable and challenging game. </div>\r\n<div> </div>\r\n<div><strong>Campaign System</strong></div>\r\n<div>Embark alone or with up to 4 friends (6 with game variant) on a 30 lantern year campaign. Each lantern year will cycle through a chaotic hunt, a showdown with a monster, and the development of your settlement. With so much emphasis on player choice, no two campaign runs will be alike.</div>\r\n<div> </div>\r\n<div><strong>Monster AI System</strong></div>\r\n<div>You will fight 8 monsters, each controlled by their own pair of decks that scale to 3 levels of difficulty. (Except for the final encounter, it has only 1 level and it's HARD!) Every encounter, even with the same monster, is diverse and valuable. No two showdowns will resolve the same way. Players will have to plan their gear and keep their minds sharp to prevail.</div>\r\n<div> </div>\r\n<div><strong>Gear System</strong></div>\r\n<div>In Monster, survivors will craft gear using resources earned from defeating monsters or found on their hunt. Each survivor has a gear grid, and can slot up to 9 pieces of gear at a time.

  "descriptionPreview": "  Kingdom Death: Monster  is a fully cooperative, tabletop, hobby game experience. Unite to survive by hunting monsters and collectively guiding the development of your settlement through a 30 year, self-running campaign. \r\n   \r\n Every decision matters. A space moved during the showdown, every resource spent to craft a piece of gear, what principles your settlement upholds - all can have lasting impact on this highly replayable and challenging game.  \r\n   \r\n  Campaign System  \r\n Embark alone or with up to 4 friends (6 with game variant) on a 30 lantern year campaign. Each lantern year will cycle through a chaotic hunt, a showdown with a monster, and the development of your settlement. With so much emphasis on player choice, no two campaign runs will be alike. \r\n   \r\n  Monster AI System  \r\n You will fight 8 monsters, each controlled by their own pair of decks that scale to 3 levels of difficulty. (Except for the final encounter, it has only 1 level and it's HARD!) Every encounter, even with the same monster, is diverse and valuable. No two showdowns will resolve the same way. Players will have to plan their gear and keep their minds sharp to prevail. \r\n   \r\n  Gear System  \r\n In Monster, survivors will craft gear using resources earned from defeating monsters or found on their hunt. Each survivor has a gear grid, and can slot up to 9 pieces of gear at a time. What gear you will carry and how you arrange it can unlock advantages that may make the difference between life and death. \r\n   \r\n  Story Event System  \r\n You will encounter 40+ story events that will shape the story of your unique campaign. Your settlement's decisions and discoveries affect how the story events unfold. Story Events cover everything from setting up and fighting a monster to dramatic turning points in your settlements history.  \r\n   \r\n  Kingdom Death: Monster Contents  \r\n   \r\n 19 lbs of Nightmare Horror Gaming \r\n 235 page hardcover rulebook, 18 hard plastic sprues of miniatures, 1000+ matte game cards, 400+ unique pieces of art, and 86 full page illustrations. \r\n 1 x Hardcover Rule Book - 11\" x 8.5\" 235 Pages. \r\n 1 x Showdown Board - 2' x 3' ( Heavy 3mm Game Board Matte ) \r\n 1 x Hunt / Settlement Board ( Heavy 3mm Game Board Matte ) \r\n 2 x Token Sheet - 127 Tokens \r\n 1 x Terrain Token Sheet - 31 Terrain Tiles \r\n 1 x Monster Controller Panel \r\n 4 x Gear Grids \r\n 1 x Character Record Sheet Pad ( 50 Sheets, 6\"x6\") \r\n 1 x Settlement Record Sheet Pad ( 50 Sheets, 8.5\" x 11\") \r\n 5 x 10 sided black Kingdom Death dice \r\n 1 x 10 sided white Kingdom Death dice \r\n 4 x 6 sided Hit location dice \r\n 1 x 10 sided translucent orange Kingdom Death Death Die \r\n   \r\n Kingdom Death: Monster Contents - Miniatures \r\n 4 x Starting Survivors \r\n 1 x White Lion \r\n 1 x Butcher \r\n 1 x Screaming Antelope \r\n 1 x Kings Man \r\n 1 x The Hand \r\n 1 x Phoenix \r\n 1 x Watcher \r\n 1 x Gold Smoke Knight \r\n 1 x Unarmored Armor Kit (Creates 4 Survivors.) \r\n 1 x Rawhide Armor Kit (Creates 4 Survivors.) \r\n 1 x Leather Armor Kit (Creates 4 Survivors.) \r\n 1 x White Lion Armor Kit (Creates 4 Survivors.) \r\n 1 x Screaming Fur Armor Kit (Creates 4 Survivors.) \r\n 1 x Phoenix Armor Kit (Creates 4 Survivors.) \r\n 1 x Lantern Armor Kit (Creates 4 Survivors.) \r\n 4 x Bonus Mystery Miniatures \r\n 4 x Starting Survivor Heads for Armor Kit customization \r\n 9 x Assorted Survivor Heads for Armor Kit customization \r\n 150+ Gear for Armor Kit customization (Every weapon in the game represented!) \r\n 10+ Masks \r\n 10 x Decorative Stone Face Base Inserts \r\n 36 x Kingdom Death 30mm Base + Insert \r\n 6 x Kingdom Death 50mm Base + Insert \r\n 1 x Kingdom Death 100mm Base + Insert  ",

There are several options at your disposal - brute force, trickery, clever use of skills. \r\n Customize your character and use your limited resources wisely - only the craftiest and the most resilient survivors will make it out alive. \r\n \r\n There are a  variety  of monsters that produce unique challenging depending on the combination in which you encounter them \r\n The game throws a real  challenge  at you, but you will get better with every game you play, learning how to best prepare \r\n You have several  choices  in how you overcome your foes including trickery, combat or use of skills \r\n Unbroken is a game of  calculated risk  – how much danger will you put yourself in to have a chance of surviving? \r\n It’s all about the  resource management . Unbroken rewards strategy and preparation with only a small element of luck. \r\n ",

Stomp on some fire ants, shriek at a grumpy troll, or strike the menacing orange dragon with a magical silver sword. Choose your strategy carefully because the landscape of Dragonwood is ever-changing. Only the bravest will overcome the odds to emerge victorious!",
